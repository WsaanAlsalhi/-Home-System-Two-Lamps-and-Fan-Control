# -Home-System-Two-Lamps-and-Fan-Control
Simple Arduino home system controlling two lamps and a fan. Lamps toggle ON/OFF by a button. Fan toggles ON/OFF and speed adjusts via potentiometer.
Overview
This Arduino project simulates a simple home control system with:

Two lamps (white LEDs) controlled by a button (toggle ON/OFF).

A fan (DC motor) controlled by another button (toggle ON/OFF).

Fan speed adjusted using a potentiometer.

# Components Used
 1. Arduino Uno (or compatible)
 2. 2 × White LEDs (representing lamps)
 3. 2 × 220Ω resistors
 4. 1 × DC motor (fan)
 5. 1 × NPN transistor or motor driver (optional, for motor control)
 6. 1 × Potentiometer (to adjust fan speed)
 7. 2 × Push buttons
 8. Jumper wires and breadboard
 9. Power supply (for fan motor if needed)

# Circuit Description
 1. Button 1 toggles the lamps ON and OFF.
 2. Button 2 toggles the fan ON and OFF.
 3. Potentiometer controls the fan speed (PWM).

# How It Works
 1. Press the lamp button to switch the lamps ON or OFF.
 2. Press the fan button to start or stop the fan.
 3. Adjust the potentiometer knob to increase or decrease the fan speed when it is ON.
